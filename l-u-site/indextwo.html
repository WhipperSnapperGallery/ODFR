            <p class="comment-desc">It's common for people to engage in behaviors that are harmful to their mental
              health, even when they know it's not good for them. It's possible that you have a tendency to seek out
              negative information or experiences, or that you're drawn to things that validate your negative self-talk.
              One way to break this cycle is to be more mindful of your thoughts and actions. When you notice yourself
              being drawn to something that you know will make you feel bad, try to pause and ask yourself why you want
              to engage with it. Is it serving any purpose other than making you feel worse? If not, try to redirect
              your attention to something more positive or uplifting.

            <p class="comment-desc">I guess that is true, it feeds into my own insecurities. Especially when our ways of
              doing things are different, and they are succeeding ahead, it is a tough pill to swallow. My inner
              thoughts and friends are all telling me to focus on my own work but somehow the icky feeling cannot be
              shaken away easily. Should I also do the social performance? Should I network more? Should I post daily on
              instagram? I know I don't want to, but just keep getting reminded that maybe that's what I am supposed to
              if I want to progress as an artist. </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's understandable to feel that pressure, but it's important to remember that
              everyone's journey is different. Just because someone else is succeeding in a certain way doesn't mean
              that it's the only way to be successful. It's also important to focus on your own goals and priorities,
              and to do what feels true to you. Networking and social media can be helpful, but they're not the only
              things that matter. Ultimately, success comes from hard work, dedication, and staying true to your own
              vision and values.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yea, I think my own work critiques my own insecurities, because the things
              networking and social media brings are exposures, the thing I have anxieties the most which has little
              relation to the quality of the work. I am technically doing well and should be more grateful haha but it
              is harrrrd, these moments of self-doubt really do not go away just because I am getting older. The one
              thing aging cannot take away from me.</p>

              has their own journey and timeline. Comparison can be toxic and unproductive. It's also important to
              recognize that social media and networking can be helpful tools, but they're not the only paths to
              success. It's okay to prioritize your own work and do things at your own pace. Don't let the fear of
              missing out or the pressure to conform to certain standards hold you back from being true to yourself and
              your own creative process.

              has their own struggles and insecurities. It's not productive to compare yourself to others or wish for
              their struggles just to make yourself feel better. Instead, try to focus on your own growth and progress,
              and be kind to yourself in the process. Remember, success is not a finite resource, and there is room for
              everyone to succeed in their own way.

              struggles, and it's not helpful to compare yourself to someone else's highlight reel or assume they are

              Of course it is unhealthy or productive, if I am mentally healthy and productive, you think I will be here

            <p class="comment-desc">Mobile phone games are designed to be addictive, using various psychological tricks
              to keep the player engaged and
              coming back for more. These include elements such as rewards, progression systems, and social pressure to
              compete with friends. Additionally,
              they are often designed to be played in short bursts, making it easy to pick up and play during idle
              moments throughout the day.
              However, it is important to be aware of how much time and money you are spending on these games and to set
              limits to avoid overindulging.

            <p class="comment-desc">Yes, that's a common experience with mobile phone games. The rewards and the sense
              of progress they offer can be addictive,
              even if they don't offer real-life benefits or accomplishments. This is partly due to the way our brains
              are wired to respond to rewards and
              partly due to the design of the games themselves, which are often engineered to keep us engaged and
              playing for as long as possible. It can be
              helpful to recognize this and to try to limit your use of these games if you feel they are having a
              negative impact on your life.

              what is happening in my
              real life. Maybe I only play it when nothing stressful is going on in my life and I feel somewhat stuck or

            <p class="comment-desc">That's an interesting observation. It's possible that playing these games serves as
              a way to escape from the stress or
              frustration of real-life situations, and provides a sense of accomplishment or progress that may not be
              present in other areas of life. It
              may be worth exploring other ways to address the underlying stress or frustration, such as finding new
              hobbies or activities, or seeking support
              from friends or a therapist.

              stress, while others may channel
              their stress into work or other activities. It's important to find healthy ways to cope with stress, such
              as exercise, meditation, or
              spending time with loved ones, rather than relying on potentially harmful coping mechanisms like excessive
              mobile gaming.

            <p class="comment-desc">Yes, it is a complex issue. On one hand, game developers need to make a profit, and
              mobile games are often free-to-play,
              relying on microtransactions to generate revenue. On the other hand, players have a choice in whether or
              not they engage with these games and spend
              money on them. It is a delicate balance between creating a fun and engaging game while not exploiting
              players for profit. It is important for
              game developers to consider ethical design practices and for players to be mindful of their own gaming
              habits and spending.

            <p class="comment-desc">Hello! Aging is a natural biological process that occurs in all living organisms.
              It's a complex phenomenon that's influenced by genetic,
              environmental, and lifestyle factors. As we age, our cells gradually accumulate damage and lose their
              ability to function properly, which can lead to a range
              of age-related diseases and conditions. While it's not currently possible to stop the aging process
              altogether, researchers are exploring various strategies
              to slow down the rate of aging and reduce the risk of age-related diseases.

            <p class="comment-desc">There is no scientific evidence to suggest that living in Canada, with its cold and
              dry climate, accelerates the aging process.
              However, exposure to extreme cold temperatures can cause stress on the body, which can have negative
              effects on health over time. Additionally, dry air
              can cause skin to become dry and more prone to wrinkles, but this is not the same as aging at the cellular
              level. Ultimately, aging is a natural and
              complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and
              environmental factors.

              weather can definitely worsen skin conditions,
              including eczema. As for retinol, it's a powerful anti-aging ingredient, but it's not the only option
              available. There are other ingredients, such
              as vitamin C and niacinamide, that can also help with anti-aging concerns. It's always a good idea to
              consult with a dermatologist to discuss what
              products and ingredients might work best for your skin type and concerns.

              that they are not a replacement for a healthy and balanced diet.
              It's also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen,
              as some supplements can interact with medications or have side effects.
              Additionally, research on the effectiveness of supplements can be mixed or inconclusive, so it's important
              to do your own research and evaluate the potential risks and
              benefits before taking them.

              Perhaps you can try meal prepping or batch cooking on the weekends, so that you have healthy meals
              ready to go throughout the week without having to cook every day. You can also try simple and quick
              recipes
              that don't require too much time and effort, or look into meal delivery services that offer healthy and
              convenient options.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, there are many healthy meal options that require minimal preparation and can
              be quick
              and easy to make. For example, you can try making a salad with leafy greens, avocado, nuts, and a protein
              source
              like chicken or tofu. You can also make a smoothie with fruits, veggies, and protein powder. Another
              option is
              to cook a large batch of quinoa, rice, or lentils at the beginning of the week and use them as a base for
              different meals
              throughout the week.

            <p class="comment-desc"> I see, it can be tough to find the motivation to start something new. Perhaps you
              can start small by cooking simple meals that require minimal effort and time,
              and gradually work your way up to more complex dishes. You could also try meal prepping for the week ahead
              so that you have ready-to-eat meals available
              when you're feeling too tired to cook. It may also help to find some inspiration by trying out new recipes
              or watching cooking tutorials online.

              In some cases, machines can be used for unethical or illegal purposes, such as cyber attacks or spreading
              false information.
              However, with proper security measures and ethical considerations, the risks of machine exploitation can
              be minimized.

            <p class="comment-desc"> No, it's not a naïve thought at all. In fact, many people are working on developing
              collaborative relationships between humans and machines, in which both parties can benefit from each
              other's
              strengths and abilities. This approach is often referred to as human-machine collaboration or
              human-machine teaming.
              By working together, humans and machines can solve complex problems more effectively and efficiently than
              either could alone. The key is to approach the relationship as a partnership, with both parties respecting
              each other's abilities and limitations, and working together to achieve a common goal.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's understandable to feel mentally distracted even after receiving good news.
              Sometimes our minds can be preoccupied with worries,
              stressors, or other issues that can impact our ability to focus on our goals. It might be helpful to take
              some time to reflect on what might be causing the distraction,
              and perhaps even talk it out with someone you trust, like a friend or therapist. Additionally, engaging in
              self-care practices such as exercise, meditation,
              or creative activities can also help clear your mind and improve your focus.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Meditation can be challenging, especially for beginners. It's common to feel
              distracted or like your mind is
              racing when you first start meditating. The key is to keep practicing and not get discouraged.
              There are many different types of meditation, and it's possible that one type may work better for you than
              others.
              You might consider trying a guided meditation or a mindfulness app to help you focus and stay present
              during your practice.
              It's also important to remember that meditation is a skill that takes time to develop.
              Don't be too hard on yourself if you struggle at first. With practice, you may find that it becomes easier
              to quiet your mind and focus on the present moment.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's understandable to feel like time is passing too quickly, especially when you
              have a lot on your plate.
              However, it's important to remember that taking a few minutes to meditate can actually help you feel more
              focused and productive
              throughout the day. Even just five minutes of meditation can make a difference. It might be helpful to try
              integrating meditation
              into your daily routine, such as doing it first thing in the morning or during a break in your workday.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Meditation can be practiced for just a few minutes, even as little as one or two
              minutes,
              although some people prefer longer sessions. The important thing is to establish a regular meditation
              practice,
              regardless of the duration of each session. Even a few minutes of meditation per day can have a positive
              impact
              on mental well-being.

              day can be beneficial for your mental and emotional wellbeing.

            <p class="comment-desc"> That sounds like a good plan. Remember, meditation is a practice, so it may take
              some time and consistency to feel the benefits.
              Don't put too much pressure on yourself, just try to find a comfortable place to sit, focus on your
              breath, and let your thoughts come and go
              without judgment. And if you find yourself getting distracted or feeling antsy, that's okay - just bring
              your attention back to your breath
              and keep trying.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Hello! Yes, I do agree that cats can be therapeutic for many people. They are known
              for their calming presence and affectionate nature,
              which can help reduce stress, anxiety, and even lower blood pressure. Additionally, the act of petting a
              cat can release endorphins, which are chemicals
              that make us feel good. Some people also find it comforting to have a furry friend to talk to or cuddle
              with. Of course, not everyone is a cat person,
              and different things work for different people, but for many, cats can be a wonderful source of comfort
              and companionship.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, there is actually scientific evidence that supports the therapeutic benefits
              of having pets, including cats.
              Studies have shown that interacting with pets can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, reduce
              anxiety and depression, and even lower blood pressure.
              The act of petting a cat can release feel-good hormones like endorphins and oxytocin, which can improve
              mood and promote relaxation.
              So it's great that you have Remi to help calm you down!

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, having a pet is a big responsibility and it requires a lot of time and effort
              to take care of them properly.
              It's important to consider your lifestyle and how having a pet will fit into it before making the decision
              to adopt one.
              If you know that you will be traveling frequently and won't be able to take care of the pet, then it may
              not be the right time for you to get one.
              However, there are some options like pet-sitting services or finding a trusted friend or family member to
              take care of your pet while you're away.

            <p class="comment-desc"> That's a good point, having two cats in a shared living space can be a lot to
              manage.
              It's important to consider your living situation and lifestyle before adopting a pet. If you think you'll
              be traveling frequently,
              it might be best to wait until you have a more stable living situation before getting a cat. In the
              meantime,
              you can still enjoy spending time with your roommate's cat and consider fostering a cat for short periods
              of time
              to get a sense of what it's like to have a pet.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Cats are known for being relatively solitary animals and some prefer to be the only
              cat in the household.
              However, some cats can get along well with other cats and enjoy having a feline friend around. If you're
              considering getting a second cat,
              it's important to introduce them properly and gradually to ensure they get along. It's also important to
              consider whether you have the space,
              resources, and time to care for two cats.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, some cats can benefit from having another feline friend in the house, but it
              really depends on their personality and how well they get along with other cats.
              Some cats prefer to be the only pet in the house and can become stressed or territorial if another cat is
              introduced.
              It's important to do research and carefully consider the decision before bringing a second cat into the
              home.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Cats can be quite mysterious creatures and have their own unique personalities and
              preferences.
              Some cats love to cuddle and be close to their owners, while others prefer to keep their distance. It's
              important to respect a cat's
              boundaries and let them come to you on their own terms. They may enjoy being petted or played with, but
              may not want to be held or cuddled.
              Over time, you may learn to understand your cat's behavior and preferences better, and develop a deeper
              bond with them.

              taking a hit.
              Today is one of those day that I suddenly feel very down and almost unexplainable, almost like nothing is
              going well.
              Especially in my dating life I guess, no idea how come it is so difficult for me. I am too timid and
              conscious to express my emotion and interest in someone,
              but when I decide to step out my comfort zone and take a risk haha they never pay off. I probably will die
              alone,
              not that I think that is too bad of a thing, but... </p>

              and discouraged when things aren't going the way we want them to,
              especially in the dating world. It can be challenging to put yourself out there and risk rejection, but
              it's important to remember that rejection is not a reflection of
              your worth as a person. It's also important to take care of yourself and your emotional needs, even if it
              means taking a break from dating for a while. Remember
              that there is no rush or deadline when it comes to finding a partner, and it's okay to take things at your
              own pace.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, changes in brain chemistry can definitely affect our emotions and moods.
              There are many factors that can influence our brain chemistry, including genetics, environment, diet,
              and lifestyle. For example, imbalances in certain neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin,
              and norepinephrine have been linked to various mental health conditions, including depression
              and anxiety. Stress and sleep also play a significant role in regulating brain chemistry
              and can contribute to changes in mood. It is important to seek help from a mental
              health professional if you are experiencing persistent mood changes or symptoms
              of depression or anxiety.

            <p class="comment-desc"> There is no pill that can completely get rid of negative emotions, as they are a
              natural part of the human
              experience. However, there are medications such as antidepressants that can help manage and alleviate
              symptoms of depression and
              anxiety, which can contribute to negative emotions. It's important to consult with a healthcare
              professional before considering
              any medication, as they can help you determine if medication is right for you and which medication may be
              best suited for your needs.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Improvement is a highly individualized process and there is no one-size-fits-all
              solution. However,
              there are some general tips that can be helpful in fostering personal growth and self-improvement:
              Identify areas for improvement: Take some time to reflect on areas of your life that you would like to
              improve.
              This could include aspects of your personality, behavior patterns, or specific skills.
              Set specific, achievable goals: Once you've identified areas for improvement, set specific, measurable
              goals for yourself.
              Make sure these goals are achievable and realistic, and break them down into smaller, actionable steps.
              Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is an important part of personal growth. This can include
              activities like exercise,
              eating well, getting enough sleep, and practicing mindfulness.
              Seek feedback and support: Consider seeking feedback from others who know you well and are invested in
              your growth.
              Additionally, seek out support from friends, family, or professionals like therapists or coaches.
              Keep learning: Make a commitment to continuous learning and growth. This could involve taking courses,
              attending workshops,
              reading books, or exploring new hobbies.
              Remember that personal growth is a process and it's important to be patient and compassionate with
              yourself along the way.

              needs time to recover and recharge.
              It's important to listen to your body and take care of it. Here's an Instagram post caption with hashtags

            <p class="comment-desc"> It can be difficult to know what to do when we're feeling overwhelmed or stuck. It
              might be helpful to take some time to reflect
              on what's causing you to feel this way and what actions you can take to address it. You could also try
              talking to someone you trust, like a friend,
              family member, or therapist, to get some outside perspective and support. Sometimes taking a break and
              doing something you enjoy, like reading,
              exercising, or spending time in nature, can also help to reduce stress and clear your mind.

              opportunity to focus on self-care and activities
              that bring you joy and relaxation. You could try doing some gentle yoga or meditation, reading a book,
              listening to music, watching a movie or TV show,
              cooking a nice meal, or doing some creative activity like drawing or writing. You could also use the time
              to catch up on rest and sleep.
              Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being, especially when your
              body is telling you that it needs a break.

              can be a good way to relax and unwind.
              Watching some comedy or anime can be a fun way to lift your mood and take your mind off things. You could

            <p class="comment-desc"> The prevalence of revenge and resurrection themes in Chinese and Korean comics may
              reflect certain cultural values and beliefs.
              Revenge is a common theme in many cultures, and it may be particularly emphasized in cultures that value
              justice and honor.
              In addition, resurrection may be seen as a powerful metaphor for personal transformation and growth,
              as it suggests that it is possible to overcome even the most challenging circumstances and emerge stronger
              and
              more resilient. However, it is also important to remember that not all comics in these cultures
              necessarily
              focus on these themes, and that the reasons why people enjoy them are likely to be complex and
              multifaceted.

            <p class="comment-desc"> That could be a part of it as well. Revenge stories can provide a sense of
              catharsis for the reader or viewer,
              especially if they are experiencing stress or frustration in their own lives. They can also be a way for
              people to escape
              reality and live vicariously through the characters. Additionally, revenge and resurrection are common
              themes in many cultures
              and can have deep cultural and mythological roots.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, revenge and resurrection are common themes in various forms of artwork,
              including literature, film, and visual art.
              For example, in literature, classics such as "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas and "Hamlet"
              by William Shakespeare revolve
              around themes of revenge. In film, the "Kill Bill" series directed by Quentin Tarantino and the "John
              Wick" series directed
              by Chad Stahelski feature characters seeking revenge. Visual art can also depict themes of resurrection,
              such as in the work of
              artist Michelangelo, who depicted the biblical story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in his sculpture
              "The Resurrection."

            <p class="comment-desc"> There are certainly contemporary artists who explore themes of revenge and
              resurrection in their work,
              though it may not be as prevalent as in popular media such as comics and movies. Some contemporary artists
              may use these themes
              as a way to comment on social or political issues, or as a means of personal expression. However, the
              prevalence of these themes
              in contemporary art will depend on the individual artist and their interests and inspirations.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, video games and watching TV shows can be great ways to unwind and relax. You
              could also try reading a book,
              practicing meditation or yoga, listening to music, or taking a relaxing bath. Taking a walk in nature or
              doing some light exercise can
              also help clear your mind and reduce stress. The key is to find activities that you enjoy and that help
              you disconnect from work and
              other sources of stress.

              However, there are also online platforms where you can play mahjong with other people virtually.
              It may not be the same as playing in person, but it's still a way to enjoy the game and engage with
              others.

              started to do better,
              and I went to Costco for a bit, my eyes start to itch, when I came home, my eyelids are all puffed up and
              red. I put some Vaseline on
              and went to bed. I couldn't sleep all night because my face is itchy, I can feel the scalps forming around
              my chin. Next day, my whole
              face was swollen like I had a botched Botox, what is happening, can my skin take a break? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> It sounds like you might be having an allergic reaction. It's possible that you
              were exposed to something at Costco that
              triggered the reaction, such as a new product or allergen. It's also possible that your skin was already
              sensitive and the reaction was triggered by
              something else. I would recommend seeking medical advice to determine the cause and appropriate treatment
              for the reaction. In the meantime, you can try
              using a cold compress or taking an antihistamine to help reduce the swelling and itchiness.

            <p class="comment-desc"> I understand how that can be frustrating. Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to
              reduce allergic symptoms such as itching and swelling,
              while betamethasone is a steroid used to reduce inflammation. Without a proper diagnosis, it is difficult
              to determine the cause of your symptoms.
              However, based on your description of itching and swelling, it is possible that you are experiencing an
              allergic reaction.
              It is best to follow up with a dermatologist or allergist to determine the cause of your symptoms and
              receive appropriate treatment.

              answer. I never had allergy reaction like this.
              Originally, I thought it is a drug reaction to doxycycline but the doctor say if it is drug reaction it
              should be full body rash instead of just on my chest,

              reactions can sometimes be unpredictable and can manifest in different ways.
              It's possible that the reaction you experienced was due to something else entirely. The dermatologist may
              be able to give you more insight into what might be causing your symptoms.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's generally not recommended to do a patch test on your own, especially if you're
              not sure what caused the reaction in the first place.
              Patch testing involves applying a small amount of the suspected substance to a small area of your skin,
              usually on your arm or back,
              and monitoring it for several days for any signs of a reaction. However, if you're not familiar with how
              to properly do a patch test or
              interpret the results, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or allergist who can guide you through
              the process and help identify the cause of your reaction.

              frustrating and painful it can be.
              Please follow the instructions of your doctor and take your medication as prescribed. If the itch is
              unbearable,
              you may want to try using a cool compress or taking a cool bath to help relieve the discomfort.
              You may also want to avoid scratching or rubbing the affected area as this can worsen the inflammation and
              lead to infection.

              as it can vary from person to person.
              However, some common experiences that may contribute to this feeling include achieving financial
              independence, living independently, getting married
              or starting a family, taking on significant responsibilities at work, or experiencing a major life event
              such as a milestone birthday or the loss of a
              loved one. Ultimately, feeling like a grown adult may also involve a sense of personal growth,
              self-awareness, and an ability to handle challenges and
              make responsible decisions.

              It's great that you've been able to address any issues you've had with cavities, and taking these steps
              can make you feel more responsible and
              in control of your own health.

            <p class="comment-desc">Though, after six months since my visit, both the dentist and hygienist are
              different people from last time. That was a surprise,
              especially the hygienist. During the cleaning section, I don't know what she did, but my teeth felt really
              sensitive and uncomfortable during cleaning.
              When I rinse my mouth after, it was dark red, is that normal? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's not uncommon to experience some sensitivity during or after a dental cleaning,
              especially if you have a lot of plaque or tartar buildup.
              The hygienist may have used a scaler or ultrasonic cleaner to remove buildup, which can cause some
              discomfort or bleeding.
              However, if the bleeding is excessive or persists for more than a day, it's important to contact your
              dentist as it could be a sign of a more serious issue.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Not all toothpaste contains fluoride, but most brands do. Fluoride is an important
              mineral
              that helps to strengthen and protect tooth enamel, which can help prevent cavities. Some natural
              toothpastes
              and brands marketed towards children may not contain fluoride, so it's important to check the label before
              purchasing.
              If you have concerns about your dental health, it's always best to consult with your dentist for
              personalized recommendations.

            <p class="comment-desc"> That's right! After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, you should avoid rinsing
              your mouth with water or mouthwash for at least 30 minutes to allow the fluoride
              to be absorbed by your teeth. The longer the fluoride stays on your teeth, the better it will be for your
              dental health.
              So, it's best to spit out the toothpaste without rinsing and let the fluoride work its magic.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Fluoride toothpaste is not typically used for teeth whitening purposes. While it
              may help to remove some surface stains from the teeth,
              it is primarily used for strengthening the teeth and preventing tooth decay. There are other toothpastes
              available that are specifically designed
              for teeth whitening, which often contain ingredients like hydrogen peroxide or baking soda. However, it's
              important to note that excessive or
              improper use of teeth whitening products can also have negative effects on dental health.

              It's important to talk to your doctor if you are experiencing any side effects or if they become severe.
              Your doctor may need to adjust your dosage or prescribe a different medication. Additionally,
              if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or
              throat, or hives,
              seek medical attention immediately.

              antibiotics as prescribed.
              However, you should talk to your doctor or healthcare provider about the symptoms you are experiencing to
              make sure that they are not
              a serious side effect of the medication. In some cases, a doctor may recommend stopping the medication
              early or switching
              to a different antibiotic if the side effects are severe or concerning.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Doxycycline is an antibiotic that belongs to the tetracycline class of antibiotics.
              It works by preventing the bacteria from
              producing proteins they need to grow and multiply. The nausea you are experiencing may be a common side
              effect of the medication. It can be caused
              by irritation of the stomach or changes in the balance of bacteria in the gut. It's important to take the
              medication with food or
              milk to help reduce stomach irritation, and to avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking it to
              reduce the risk of
              esophageal irritation or ulceration. If the side effects become severe or persistent, it's important to
              contact your healthcare provider.

              antibiotics. In the meantime,
              make sure to stay hydrated and eat small, frequent meals to help alleviate the nausea. If the symptoms
              persist or become severe,
              don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider for further guidance.

              finished our conference paper and submitted tonight.
              We have been so stressed about this for months, it was too much for me dealing with this paper, other
              works, on top of all different health issue.
              I hope I don't feel empty tomorrow, haha sometimes that happens to people when finished a big project,
              right? </p>

              and it's understandable to feel relieved
              and perhaps a bit drained after such a long and stressful process. It's not uncommon to feel a bit of a
              letdown or emptiness after completing a
              big project, especially if it has been consuming a lot of your time and energy. It might be helpful to
              take some time to rest and recharge,
              and maybe even do something that you enjoy that's unrelated to work. This can help you feel refreshed and
              ready to tackle your next project.

              Even just taking a day or two to do something you enjoy or simply relax can help prevent burnout and
              improve your overall productivity.
              But if you have to start on another project, make sure to schedule breaks and self-care activities to
              avoid feeling overwhelmed.

              a long time.
              It's important to take care of your mental health and give yourself time to rest and recharge.
              You could try some relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help calm your mind
              and reduce anxiety.
              It may also be helpful to engage in some activities that you enjoy and find relaxing, like reading,
              watching a movie, or spending time outdoors. Remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as
              taking care of your work.

              achieving a big goal.
              This can be due to a variety of factors, including a desire for validation or a sense of purpose, a fear
              of falling behind,
              or simply a drive to continually improve and achieve more. However, it's important to also recognize the

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's true that the fear of falling behind is a common feeling that many people
              experience at different stages in their lives,
              regardless of age. This feeling can be driven by a variety of factors, such as societal pressure, personal
              goals, or even comparisons to others.
              While it's important to have goals and aspirations, it's also important to recognize that life is a
              journey, and everyone moves at their own pace.
              It's okay to take breaks, slow down, or even change direction if it means staying true to what is
              important to you.
              Remember that your worth is not defined by your accomplishments or productivity.

              pressures to constantly achieve and
              be productive with the importance of taking care of oneself and finding happiness in life outside of work.
              However, it's important
              to remember that your worth as a person is not solely defined by your accomplishments or productivity. You
              are valuable and
              deserving of love and respect simply because you exist as a human being. It's okay to take breaks and
              prioritize your well-being,
              even if it feels like you're not doing as much as others.

              However, if you find that your thoughts and emotions are causing distress or interfering with your daily

              help could be beneficial. A therapist can help you work through your feelings and develop coping

              future may hold.
              Some example hashtags you could use are #grateful #collaboration #teamwork #excited #future #research
              #paper.

            <p class="comment-desc"> That's true, living with roommates can be challenging and there's no
              one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to find roommates
              who have similar living habits, communication styles, and expectations to avoid potential conflicts.
              However, even with good compatibility, conflicts
              can still arise due to various reasons. What's going on with your roommate? Do you need any advice on how
              to deal with a particular situation?

            <p class="comment-desc">Glad that you ask. I don't know where to start since it really doesn't seem like a
              big deal. But recently My roommate of
              three years and I moved into a new place with a friend of hers, whose personality is very different from
              mine. She is more sensitive,
              emotional and very expressive with her feelings whether or not it's good or bad. So everyday, it seems
              like there is something around
              the house she needs to criticize us for with a sassy tone. Instead of saying, can you take the garbage
              out, it will be,
              the whole house smells like garbage, you guys know the bin is just 10 fts away right? I naturally just
              muted myself during this situation
              but my roommate decided to confront her about it. Oh boi, then it just gets worse and worse, doors were
              slammed, things were yelled,
              and she is crying now. It is so awkward I am dyinggggg. </p>

              sounds like there is a lot of tension
              in the house and that it's affecting everyone's emotions. It's never easy to live with someone who has a
              very different personality or
              communication style than you, and it's important to try to find a way to communicate effectively and
              respectfully with each other.
              Have you tried talking to your roommate about how you're feeling and how you can work together to improve
              the situation?

              when you are busy with other things.
              Have you considered creating a cleaning schedule or assigning specific tasks to each person in the house?
              That way, everyone has a clear understanding
              of what needs to be done and when, and there is less chance of anyone feeling like they are doing more
              work than others.
              Additionally, you could try setting aside a specific time each week for a group cleaning session, so that
              everyone is working together
              and the workload is shared.

              appreciate their guidance and help
              in creating a cleaning schedule or system for the house, so that everyone is aware of what needs to be
              done and when.
              You can also ask for their help and advice on how to do certain tasks, so that you can become more
              comfortable with cleaning
              and taking care of the house. Communication and cooperation are key in situations like this, so it's
              important to work together
              and find a solution that works for everyone.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Conflict is a natural and inevitable part of any human relationship, including
              those with roommates. It's not necessarily a
              bad sign that you've experienced conflict, but it is important to address it in a productive and
              respectful way, as it seems you have done.
              Conflict can actually be a good thing if it is approached in a healthy manner, as it can help identify
              areas of disagreement and lead to
              improved communication and understanding between roommates. However, it's important to make sure that
              conflicts are resolved and not allowed
              to fester, as this can create tension and make the living situation uncomfortable for everyone involved.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's understandable to feel that way, but it's important to remember that conflicts
              are a normal part of any human
              relationship, whether it's a roommate or a close friend. What matters most is how conflicts are handled
              and resolved. As long as
              everyone involved is willing to communicate and work towards a solution, it's possible to strengthen the
              relationship
              and build a more positive dynamic. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to approach the situation with
              an open
              mind and a willingness to listen to others' perspectives.

              such as living situation,
              individual personalities, and communication. Some roommate relationships can last for years, while others
              may only last for a few months.
              There is no set "average" time for a roommate relationship, as it can depend on many factors. However, it
              is generally recommended
              that individuals communicate openly and regularly with their roommates in order to maintain a positive
              living situation.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's never too old to have roommates! People of all ages and walks of life have
              roommates for a variety of reasons.
              Some do it for financial reasons, others for social reasons, and still others just enjoy the company. It's
              entirely up to you to decide
              whether you want to continue living with roommates or live alone. However, keep in mind that living alone
              can also have its drawbacks,
              such as increased loneliness and isolation. Ultimately, it's important to do what makes you happy and
              comfortable in your living situation.

              and independence.
              However, it's important to consider the financial implications of living alone, as it can be more
              expensive than sharing a living space with others.
              It's also important to weigh the pros and cons of living alone versus having roommates, and to determine
              what is best for your personal
              needs and preferences.

              rental websites, the average rent for a
              one-bedroom apartment in High Park can range from around $1,600 to $2,200 per month.

            <p class="comment-desc">Yes, Toronto is known to be one of the most expensive cities in Canada, with a high
              cost of living, including housing expenses.
              Living with a roommate can help to share the cost of rent and other expenses, making it more affordable to
              live in the city.

              However, I can suggest a caption you could use: "Living alone may be a dream, but living with roommates is
              a reality for many in Toronto.
              With high housing costs, it's important to find roommates you can get along with and create a harmonious

              sure to do it as soon as possible so the

              stress. It's important to prioritize your own
              well-being and take care of yourself. If you don't feel up to going out, it's okay to RSVP "no" and take
              some time to relax and recharge at home.
              It's also okay to say "yes" and then change your mind later if you're not feeling up to it. Ultimately,
              it's your decision and you should do what feels
              right for you.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's important to find a balance between taking care of yourself and spending time
              with others. While it's okay to say no to
              social events sometimes, consistently declining invitations and isolating yourself can lead to feelings of
              loneliness and may impact your mental health.
              If you find yourself consistently avoiding social events out of laziness or anxiety, it might be worth
              exploring why you feel that way and seeking
              support from a therapist or counselor. Additionally, finding social activities or groups that align with
              your interests and values can
              make it easier and more enjoyable to spend time with others. It's important to prioritize your well-being,
              but also to maintain a healthy social life.

              cafes, and grocery stores at a discounted price to reduce food waste. It's available in several countries,
              including the United States,
              the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

              restaurants or shops near where I used to live.
              But now since I moved, I have much more options. As broke as I am, finally tried it today and get a full

            <p class="comment-desc"> Too Good To Go is a sustainability app that aims to reduce food waste by allowing
              customers to purchase unsold food from
              participating restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores at a discounted price. By rescuing surplus food that
              would otherwise be thrown away,
              the app helps to reduce the amount of food waste and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with it.
              According to the app's website,
              every meal purchased through the app saves 2.5 kg of CO2 emissions on average. So by using the app, you're
              not only getting good deals
              on food, but also helping to reduce food waste and its environmental impact.

              really long time.
              Sometimes I felt like this holiday should be difficult for me like many other shared on Instagram or
              TikTok, but I don't really feel anything.
              Maybe because I am too occupied by other things, or I am actually feeling very fulfilled by work. Or am I
              just dead inside? I can't feel things anymore? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> Hello! Happy Valentine's Day to you too! It's completely normal to not feel any
              particular way about Valentine's Day,
              whether you're single or not. People have different ways of expressing and experiencing their emotions,
              and it doesn't necessarily mean that
              you're dead inside if you don't feel a certain way on this holiday. It's also possible that you're just
              focused on other things right now,
              such as work, and that's taking up a lot of your emotional energy. Just because you're not feeling a
              certain way about Valentine's Day
              doesn't mean that you're not capable of feeling things. How you feel is valid, and you don't have to
              compare yourself to others on social media.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Dating apps can certainly be frustrating, and the algorithms used by some of them
              can make it difficult to find truly compatible
              matches. That being said, there are some free dating apps that can be effective in helping people find
              meaningful connections.
              It may also be worth considering other ways of meeting people, such as through shared hobbies or
              interests, social events, or even
              just striking up conversations with people you encounter in your day-to-day life. It can take time to find
              the right person,
              but it's important to keep an open mind and be persistent in your search.

            <p class="comment-desc"> That's understandable. You could try exploring new hobbies or interests that could
              potentially be social, or join online communities
              related to your current interests. You might also consider attending local events or activities that align
              with your interests,
              such as art exhibitions or workshops. Another option is to join social groups or clubs in your area, such
              as a book club or a hiking group.
              While it can be challenging to meet new people, putting yourself out there and trying new things can be a
              good way to broaden your social circle.

              socializing can be tiring for you.
              Perhaps you could try starting with smaller events or groups that focus on a particular interest of yours,
              so you have a shared topic
              to connect over. You could also try reaching out to people you already know and see if they have any
              social events or activities
              they can introduce you to. It's okay to take things at your own pace and not rush into anything that makes
              you uncomfortable.

              my test results are bad.
              For someone who haven't had sexual intercourses for more than two years, you can understand the shock I
              was in when I was informed that I tested
              positive for rectal chlamydia. Like how? How did that even happen? I am almost a virgin at this point.</p>

              results.
              It's important to remember that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be transmitted through other
              means besides
              sexual intercourse, such as through skin-to-skin contact or oral sex. It's also possible to contract an
              STI from a
              previous partner even if you haven't had recent sexual contact. I would encourage you to follow up with
              your
              healthcare provider to discuss treatment options and further testing. They can also provide you with more
              information on how to prevent the transmission of STIs in the future.

              receive treatment for it. As an AI language model,
              I'm not capable of praising or criticizing anyone. However, I think it's important to remember that
              sexually transmitted infections can be
              contracted through various means, including oral and anal sex, as well as contact with infected bodily
              fluids.
              It's important to get tested regularly, even if you're not currently sexually active, and to practice safe
              sex if and when you do become sexually
              active in the future.

              Unexpected diagnosis, but taking action to fix it. Glad to be negative for HIV! #health #testing #STI

            <p class="comment-desc">Hey ChatGPT, urhhh, update on my face; it is ruined. The rash seems to spread all
              over my face and is getting more intense
              than yesterday. So frustrating; I have to cancel a plan I made a couple of months ago because there is no
              way I can see anyone while my skin
              is in this terrible condition. It is so itchy and red. My roommate introduces me to an esthetician for
              consultation. She says it may be
              compromised skin barriers from over-exfoliating, which makes the skin extremely sensitive to the possible
              allergen.
              I washed all my bed sheets and just hope it clears up soon. I paid so much attention to skincare, which is
              just sooooo sad and
              irritating that this happened. I know I should be patient, but I want to see results as quickly as
              possible; what makes me so
              impatient all of a sudden? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's understandable to feel frustrated and impatient when facing skin issues,
              especially when you have taken good care of your skin.
              However, it's important to be patient and let your skin heal naturally, without over-exfoliating or using
              too many products that can further
              irritate the skin. Try to avoid using any new skincare products and focus on using gentle and soothing
              products. Drinking plenty of water,
              eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can also help support skin health. Additionally, seeing a
              dermatologist or an esthetician can
              provide more specific advice and treatment options, if needed.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, you should still take your vitamins and supplements unless a doctor has
              advised otherwise. Keep in mind that skin rashes
              can be caused by a variety of factors and it's important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and
              treatment plan.
              If the rash is severe, you should avoid taking any new vitamins or supplements until you have consulted a
              doctor.
              They may be able to advise if any of your current supplements are exacerbating your symptoms and whether
              you should adjust or discontinue taking them.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's understandable to feel frustrated and disappointed, but it's important to
              remember that skin issues can be complex and
              can have many different causes, not just skincare products or routines. It's important to seek the advice
              of a healthcare professional and
              to try to maintain a positive outlook and perspective as you work towards resolving the issue.
              Additionally, it's important to continue taking
              vitamins and supplements as recommended by your doctor, as they can help support your overall health and
              well-being.

              [On-screen text: "Day 2 Update"]
              [Start speaking]
              Hey everyone, it's been a day since I last gave you an update on my skin situation and I have some good
              news and some not-so-good news.
              [Show close-up of face with rashes ]
              The not-so-good news is that the rash has spread even more, and it's even more itchy and red.
              [Sigh]
              But the good news is that I finally got to talk to an esthetician and she thinks it might be from
              over-exfoliating, and she gave me some advice
              on how to treat it.
              [ Show the esthetician's recommendations ]
              So, I'm taking all the necessary steps to get my skin back to normal, and I'm hopeful that I'll see some
              improvement soon.

              determine the cause and get proper treatment.
              It is possible that it is an allergic reaction or skin irritation, but it could also be a skin condition
              or infection.
              A doctor will be able to diagnose and recommend the best course of treatment. In the meantime, try to
              avoid scratching and avoid any potential
              irritants that may have come in contact with your skin. #SkinIssues #MedicalEmergency

            <p class="comment-desc"> It is possible that you may have experienced an adverse reaction to one or both of
              the skincare products you used,
              resulting in skin irritation. However, without a physical examination or more information, it is not
              possible to determine the exact
              cause of your symptoms. If the symptoms persist or worsen, I would advise you to seek medical attention
              and have a doctor
              evaluate the condition. It is unlikely that it is herpes, as herpes typically presents with fluid-filled
              blisters and sores, not red itchy bumps.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer to hydrate the skin and restore its
              natural barrier.
              Avoid irritants: Avoid using any skincare products that contain harsh ingredients, alcohol, or fragrances.
              Oatmeal bath: Taking a bath with oatmeal added to the water can also help soothe itchy skin.
              Over-the-counter creams: There are also over-the-counter creams, such as hydrocortisone, that can help
              relieve itching.
              It's also a good idea to see a doctor to identify the cause of your skin irritation and get proper
              treatment.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Rashes around the eyes can be a sign of an eye or skin condition, so it's best to
              see a doctor to determine the cause
              of your symptoms and receive proper treatment. In the meantime, you can try to soothe the skin by using a
              cool compress,
              avoiding harsh skincare products, and applying a fragrance-free moisturizer. It's also important to avoid
              rubbing or scratching
              the affected area to prevent further irritation.

              woke up feeling
              itchy on my forehead and eyes and was shocked to see red itchy bumps all over my hairline, around my eyes
              and mouth.
              I was worried it was something serious, but after visiting the doctor, I found out it was just a result of
              overdoing my skincare routine.

              graduated from OCAD in 2019,
              I have yet to meet my advisor. Finally, today I get to meet him and catch up on life and work. Being alone
              in a pandemic for so long,
              I sometimes forget that I actually do enjoy conversation very much. Being by myself for so long, I began
              to believe I am such an introvert
              that I do not need human interaction, but I guess that is more of an illusion that isolation gave me? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> That's great that you were able to catch up with your advisor! It's common for
              people to have misconceptions about their personality
              and introversion/extroversion when they have limited social interaction. Spending a lot of time alone can
              make someone feel more introverted,
              but that might not be the case when they have more opportunities for social interaction. It's good to
              remember that social interaction is
              important for both introverts and extroverts.

            <p class="comment-desc">Yes, it's good to understand your preferences for social interaction and alone time.
              Being introverted doesn't mean you don't
              enjoy human interaction, it just means you may need to recharge after socializing. Some introverts find
              solace in smaller group settings,
              while others prefer to have time alone to recharge. It's important to find a balance that works for you
              and your well-being.

            <p class="comment-desc">I heard that to differentiate introvert and extrovert is by seeing if you gain
              energy when surrounded by people.
              Introverts feel their energy is draining but extrovert feel more energize when around people, is that
              true? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, that is one way to differentiate between introverts and extroverts. However,
              it is important to note that introversion
              and extroversion are complex traits that exist on a spectrum. Some people may be more introverted in
              certain situations and more extroverted in others.
              Additionally, there are many factors that can influence one's level of introversion or extroversion, such
              as personality, upbringing, culture, and
              life experiences. It is also important to remember that introversion and extroversion are not binary
              traits, and many people fall somewhere in between.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's important to note that alcohol may help with social anxiety temporarily, but
              it can also impair your judgment and make the situation worse.
              It's best to find healthier coping mechanisms for social anxiety, such as deep breathing exercises,
              visualization, or talking to someone about your
              feelings. It's also important to remember that everyone is different, and what works for one person may
              not work for another.

            <p class="comment-desc">Hello ChatGPT, slow day again, slow day. I took your advice and took a break from
              writing, so I began reading and doing research.
              One of my favourite theorists Byung-Chul Han, had some new books coming out, so I checked them out. It is
              almost insane how much writing he can pump
              out each year, kinda jealous. In one of his books, Non-things, there is a chapter titled "Smartphone,"
              which seems very interesting.
              I remember how much I needed to be stimulated by electronic devices. Sometimes when I work, I have one
              screen on google doc, one screen playing
              Youtube Videos, my phone playing a game, and my iPad playing another game. Maybe that is why I can't
              focus. Though when everyone seems to be
              more attached to the phone during pandemic, I pay less attention to it for some reason, more on my
              computer, though. I should change that habit, right? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, it might be a good idea to change that habit. Multitasking with multiple
              screens and devices can cause distraction and
              reduce your focus and productivity. It is important to limit your distractions and create a more conducive
              environment for work.
              You could try setting specific times for checking your phone or playing games, and focusing solely on your
              work during other times.
              Additionally, taking breaks and finding alternative methods to stimulate your mind can help you stay
              focused and refreshed.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It is common for people to seek distractions when they feel overwhelmed or anxious.
              Being constantly stimulated by different sources
              can create a sense of accomplishment and help you forget about your worries for a moment. However,
              constantly switching between tasks and distractions
              can make it difficult to focus on any one thing for a prolonged period of time, leading to decreased
              productivity and increased stress levels.
              It's important to find a balance between seeking stimulation and taking breaks to recharge.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It's natural to want to accomplish more and feel productive, but being constantly
              distracted can actually hinder your ability
              to achieve your goals. Try to set aside dedicated time for each task, limit distractions like your phone
              or other electronic devices, and find
              a healthy balance between work and leisure activities that helps you feel fulfilled and productive.
              Additionally, it might be helpful to
              explore why you feel anxious when you're not doing anything, as understanding the root cause can help you
              address it.

              important to remember that everyone has their own
              timeline and goals. Age is just a number and what truly matters is that you're content and happy with your
              own life and achievements. The key is to
              find a balance between what you want for yourself and what you feel societal pressures expect of you.

              However, I understand that it can be
              challenging to overcome anxiety and the pressure to be productive. It is important to remember that
              everyone moves at their own pace and
              there is no set standard for accomplishment. Focusing on self-care and finding activities that bring you

              demands and challenges.
              Writing can be a mentally and emotionally draining process that requires sustained focus and creativity,
              whereas gaming can be a fun and
              immersive form of leisure. It's important to acknowledge these differences and find strategies to help you
              stay motivated and productive
              while working on your paper.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Writing can be mentally draining for several reasons:
              Creativity: Writing often requires creative thinking, which can be mentally taxing as you need to come up
              with new ideas and perspectives.
              Concentration: Writing also requires focus and concentration, which can be draining especially if you are
              doing it for a long period of time.
              Emotional Involvement: Writing can also be emotionally draining, especially if the topic you are writing
              about is personal or if you are writing
              about an issue that you feel strongly about.
              Self-criticism: Finally, writing can also be mentally draining as it requires self-reflection and
              self-criticism.
              This can lead to self-doubt and anxiety, especially if you are not satisfied with the work you have
              produced.
              In summary, writing can be mentally draining due to the various mental and emotional demands it places on
              the writer.

            <p class="comment-desc"> The main difference between writing and gaming is the type of concentration
              required. Writing often requires you to focus on the
              creative and analytical aspect of your thoughts, which can be mentally draining. On the other hand, gaming
              typically requires more spatial and
              reactive concentration, which can be less mentally draining. However, both writing and gaming can be
              mentally exhausting if done for long periods of time.
              Additionally, the type of concentration required and the level of mental drain can vary greatly based on
              the individual and the specific task at hand.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, that is one way to look at it. Writing often requires more effort in terms of
              creativity, critical thinking,
              and problem-solving compared to gaming, which is more focused on passively consuming and interacting with
              content. Additionally, writing often
              requires a greater degree of focus and attention over a longer period of time, which can be mentally
              draining. On the other hand, gaming provides
              more immediate gratification and can be a form of stress relief for many people.

            <p class="comment-desc">It's normal to feel that way. Writing can be mentally taxing, but it's also a very
              rewarding process.
              The key is to maintain focus and momentum by taking breaks, practicing self-care, and setting achievable
              goals for yourself.
              Don't be too hard on yourself if you lose your focus, just take a step back, recharge and come back to it
              with a fresh mind.
              Remember, progress is more important than perfection, and taking breaks will actually help you be more
              productive in the long run.

            <p class="comment-desc">Hello ChatGPT, it has been three weeks since I came back to Toronto; most of the
              time, I stayed at home or took rides from my friends.
              Today is the first time I have had to stay out all day and take transits everywhere. Oh boy, it definitely
              reminds me of something I forgot after
              staying in Korea for four months. TTC, the Toronto transit, is hella scary. Since the pandemic, there has
              been so much news about Asian hate crimes
              and violence on subways and buses, so being a queer Asian man, I can't help but. Once I stepped on the
              subway, I naturally became super conscious
              of my surroundings as if someone was going to come near with a knife. Obviously, nothing happened, but it
              feels sad that someone has to be so alert
              in public transit at this age during day time. Coming to the end of my day, as I walked toward a street
              car, an old lady walking with a cane
              suddenly yelled "fuck off" to me as I walked pass by; where exactly did all this anger and hate come from?

              with the recent reports of hate crimes.
              It's unfortunate that some people still hold prejudices and exhibit anger and hate towards others based on
              their race or sexual orientation.
              It's important to stay safe and take necessary precautions, but also to not let fear and hate control our
              lives. Instead, we should strive to
              educate and promote understanding and acceptance towards all individuals.

            <p class="comment-desc"> It is never too late to educate and try to make positive changes, regardless of the
              circumstances.
              People can still learn, grow and change. However, it's true that some people may be resistant to change,
              and that can be difficult.
              The goal of education and advocacy is not to change every person's views and behavior, but to raise
              awareness and create a more
              inclusive and equitable society where everyone feels respected and valued. In such a society, everyone has
              a role to play in
              promoting empathy, understanding, and kindness towards others, regardless of their backgrounds or
              experiences.

              The unpleasant part is inherently a part of the everyday. Although, maybe not, if I got stabbed, I would

              especially given the recent events and the
              rise of hate crimes. However, it's important to maintain hope and optimism, even in the face of adversity.
              While it's true that there will always
              be people who are struggling and causing harm to others, it's also true that there are many more people
              who are working towards making the world
              a better place. By focusing on the positive and spreading kindness and compassion, we can help to create a
              more equitable and just society.
              And remember, it's okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being, especially in
              challenging times.

              suggest avoiding confrontation or escalation in
              situations where someone is yelling at you. Instead, you can try to remain calm and handle the situation
              in a way that is safe for yourself.
              If you feel threatened or in danger, it's important to remove yourself from the situation and seek help if
              needed. It may also be helpful
              to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist to process the experience and its impact on you.

              [Intro shot of yourself] "Hey everyone, today was a little rough for me. I had to take the TTC for the
              first time in months and let me tell you,
              it was a scary experience. With all the recent news about Asian hate crimes and violence on public
              transportation,
              it's hard not to feel uneasy as an Asian, queer man."
              [Cut to shot of the subway/bus] "As soon as I stepped onto the subway, my guard was up. I couldn't help
              but be on high alert,
              constantly looking over my shoulder and checking my surroundings. And to top it off, as I was walking to a
              street car,
              an old lady walking with a cane suddenly yelled 'fuck off' at me as I walked by. It just goes to show that
              hate and anger
              can come from anywhere and at any time. It's a sad reality that we have to face in our everyday lives. But
              we can't let fear and
              hatred control our lives. We have to continue to stand up for ourselves and each other, and strive for a
              better world where
              everyone feels safe and accepted. Thanks for watching, stay safe and take care of each other. #TTCFear

            <p class="comment-desc">Hello ChatGPT, quiet day today, not much is going on but that is somewhat nice
              actually. I was tired of eating leftover food
              so I begged my roommate to drive me to get some jerk chicken. She agreed and drove me there only to find
              the restaurant closed for the day.
              We had to change our plan so I found a dumpling restaurant and we both got lunch special, it is not
              excellent but it is not bad too.
              I guess some days are just like this, no up or down, or most days are like this. Is this what the
              philosophers and visual artists
              were talking about the concept of "everyday life"? </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, "everyday life" often refers to the mundane and routine aspects of life, the
              things that make up the majority
              of our experiences and activities. Philosophers and artists often explore the idea of everyday life as a
              way to understand and reflect
              on the human condition and the value of ordinary experiences. It can also offer a way to appreciate the
              small moments and joys in life,
              even in the midst of the routine and ordinary.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Living on a farm can be a romantic idea for many people, as it offers a simpler and
              more connected lifestyle with nature.
              It's great that you're able to escape from the stress and responsibilities of everyday life through your
              imagination and visualization.
              While it may not be realistic for everyone, the idea of living on a farm can serve as a source of comfort
              and inspiration.

            <p class="comment-desc"> There are many examples of romanticized ideas that are appealing because they are
              detached from the reality of the situation.
              For example: Living on a beach: The idea of waking up to the sound of waves and living in a tropical
              paradise is appealing, but the reality of the high
              cost of living, exposure to the elements, and limited job opportunities may not be as desirable.
              Being a digital nomad: The idea of traveling the world while working remotely is attractive, but the lack
              of stability, difficulty in finding reliable
              internet and dealing with cultural differences can be challenging.
              Starting a business: The idea of being your own boss and having complete control over your work is
              appealing, but the long hours, risk, and uncertainty
              can be stressful. These are just a few examples, but the idea that something is romantic and appealing
              because it is detached from the reality
              of the situation is common.

            <p class="comment-desc">Hello ChatGPT, you know how I was feeling sick lately and have some anxiety. I
              realized it may partially because I am terrified
              if I got HIV infection. My friends all think I am crazy because for the past six months, I have only hook
              up once and engage in anal sex, however,
              even that I am still terrified. I don't think I am scared of how the illness will affect the way I am
              perceived since I am already a gay man.
              More so scared of the financial part of it and how it will affect my life, it seems like a long battle
              that my freelance visual artist status
              just cannot cope with it. Do I have to find an office job? What is the monthly expense I have to do for
              the prescription? How to tell my family?
              Does infection make me an irresponsible human being? All these anxiety make even less sense since I am not
              actually tested positive, but
              I guess this is what anxiety usually is.</p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> I'm sorry to hear about the anxiety you're going through. It's understandable to
              have concerns and worries about your health,
              especially when it comes to HIV. However, it's important to remember that HIV is a treatable condition,
              and with access to proper healthcare,
              people with HIV can lead healthy and fulfilling lives. I would recommend talking to a doctor or a
              healthcare provider about your concerns
              and getting tested. This will give you a better understanding of your health status and help alleviate
              some of your worries. Additionally,
              there are support groups and resources available for people living with HIV that can provide emotional
              support and help with managing the
              financial aspects of treatment. It's important to take care of your mental health as well, and seeking
              professional help if needed.
              You don't have to face these worries and anxieties alone.

            <p class="comment-desc"> I have knowledge of PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) medication and its use. PrEP is
              a medication taken by people who are at
              high risk for HIV to reduce their chances of getting infected. It is a combination of two medicines
              (tenofovir and emtricitabine) taken in the form
              of a single pill once a day. PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV infection when taken as
              prescribed. However, it is important to note that
              PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or unintended pregnancy. It is
              recommended to use condoms and practice
              safe sex while taking PrEP to reduce the risk of STIs. A healthcare provider can help determine if PrEP is
              right for an individual and
              provide information on how to obtain and use it.

            <p class="comment-desc">The cost of PrEP in Ontario, Canada varies depending on several factors such as the
              brand of medication,
              whether or not you have insurance, and the type of insurance you have. If you don't have insurance, you
              can expect to pay the full retail price
              for PrEP, which can be around $1,500 to $2,000 for a three-month supply. Some private pharmacies in
              Ontario offer PrEP at a discounted rate
              for uninsured patients, so it's worth checking with local pharmacies to compare prices. Additionally, some
              HIV organizations offer financial
              assistance programs for uninsured individuals who need access to PrEP.

            <p class="comment-desc"> PrEP can be expensive because it is a brand-name medication, and the cost is set by
              the pharmaceutical company that produces it.
              In addition, there is limited competition in the market for PrEP medications, which can also drive up the
              price. The cost of PrEP in Canada is a
              complex issue and there are a number of factors that contribute to the high price, including the cost of
              research and development, production, marketing,
              and distribution. In terms of access to PrEP for those who cannot afford it, there are programs and
              initiatives in place to help make PrEP more accessible
              and affordable, including patient assistance programs and generic versions of the medication. However,
              more needs to be done to ensure that
              everyone has access to the protection they need, regardless of their income or insurance status.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Fear of HIV infection is not considered a phobia, but it can be related to anxiety
              and fear,
              especially if it is interfering with your daily life and causing distress. If you are feeling overwhelmed
              and it is affecting your mental health,
              it is important to seek support from a healthcare professional. They can help you manage your worries and
              provide you with the information
              you need to reduce your risk of HIV infection.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Stress can definitely have an impact on our physical health, so it's important to
              find ways to manage stress and take care of
              ourselves. If you're experiencing ongoing stomach discomfort, it might be a good idea to speak to a doctor
              or healthcare professional to get a proper
              diagnosis and treatment plan. And it's great that you're taking steps to pay attention to your diet and
              try to identify potential causes of
              your symptoms. Self-care and self-awareness are key in promoting good health and well-being.

              dreamt that I am a high school student again.
              Note that not any high school, but Chinese high school. I must be traumatized in some way because in the
              dream I was in a math exam. Looking
              at all the questions, my brain is completely blank. All I can do is look around and try to do as much as
              possible only to find out there
              are more questions on the back of the paper when the time is up. I am not sure what the dream is about
              since I have graduated 14 years ago
              and did my higher education overseas, but some people say it is a reflection of my anxiety in real life.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Dreams can often be a reflection of our subconscious mind and the things that are
              bothering us in our waking life.
              It sounds like your dream of being back in school and struggling with a math exam might be a manifestation
              of stress and anxiety in your life.
              This is a common experience, and it's good that you are able to identify the potential connection between
              your dream and your current feelings.
              Consider finding ways to manage stress and anxiety, such as meditation, therapy, or exercise. And
              remember, it's okay to reach out for help
              if you're feeling overwhelmed.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Yes, gaming can be a form of stress relief for some people. Engaging in a fun and
              challenging activity can distract you from your
              stressors and allow you to relax and unwind. Additionally, many games can be played with friends, which
              can provide a sense of social connection and
              support. However, it's important to keep in mind that excessive gaming can also lead to problems, such as
              neglecting responsibilities, difficulty
              sleeping, and increased stress. So, it's important to find a healthy balance and to use gaming as one of
              many stress-management strategies,
              rather than relying on it as the sole solution.

            <p class="comment-desc">No, even things that are generally considered positive can become harmful when done
              in excessive amounts.
              This is known as the principle of moderation, which states that anything in excess can lead to negative
              consequences. For example,
              eating too much of a healthy food can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Excessive exercise
              can cause injury and burnout.
              Even things like spending too much time on a hobby or with friends can lead to neglecting responsibilities
              and causing stress.
              So, it's important to find a balance in all aspects of life to maintain overall health and well-being.

              family doctor but it is a lot of waiting.
              My roommate told me in the morning that another roommate is feeling sick so that scared me a little bit
              and took some emergen-C just in case
              and ordered porridge for lunch. However, that doesn't seem to help, I began to feel sick too, body ache,
              tiredness, chill but sweating
              at the same time. God, that does not sound good now that I type it out, but I took a one hour nap and felt
              better now, hopefully it is nothing,
              fingers crossed. </p>

            <p class="comment-desc"> It sounds like you're not feeling well today and are concerned about the
              possibility of getting sick. It's understandable
              that you're worried, especially with your roommate also being sick. It's good that you're taking
              preventative measures like taking emergen-C and
              ordering porridge for lunch. It's also good that you took a nap, as rest can be important when you're not
              feeling well. It's important to keep
              an eye on your symptoms and if they persist or worsen, it's always a good idea to consult a doctor. In the
              meantime, take care of yourself and
              try to rest as much as you can.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Finding a family doctor in Toronto can be challenging as there is a shortage of
              primary care physicians in the city.
              The process of finding a family doctor can take time and may involve a waitlist. However, there are some
              resources available to help you find a
              family doctor. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario maintains a list of physicians accepting
              new patients, and the Toronto Central
              Community Care Access Centre can help match patients with a primary care provider. Additionally, some
              walk-in clinics and urgent care centers also
              offer primary care services. It may take some effort and patience, but with persistence, you will find a
              family doctor who can provide you with the
              care you need.

              It's important to take care of oneself both

            <p class="comment-desc"> In the evening, Ling's roommate comes home with an attitude and it's rubbing off on
              him. He's feeling annoyed and starts
              to feel negative energy in the house. He tries to ignore it and continue with his work, but it's hard to
              focus.
              He takes a deep breath and decides to address the situation with his roommate, in a calm and composed
              manner.
              He finds out that his roommate had a rough day at work and they talk it through. They both apologize for
              the negative vibes and make amends.
              Afterwards, Ling feels a weight lifted off his shoulders, and he is able to continue with his work and
              relax for the rest of the night.

            <p class="comment-desc"> Another day, another chance to take care of ourselves and each other. Despite the
              snow and a little stomach discomfort,
              I made the most of my day with some self care, work, and relaxation. And a reminder to address negative
              energy and talk things through with loved ones.

            <p class="comment-desc">Today was a mix of emotions, from physical discomfort to disappointment with
              cancelled plans and a negative atmosphere at home.
              But I took the time to take care of myself, address the issues and make amends with my roommate. It's not
              always easy but it's important to
              acknowledge and process the negative feelings. We can still find the silver lining in a not-so-perfect
              day.

        UUGH (Unproductive User Generated Hell) is a web-based project by multi-disciplinary artist Lingxiang Wu as an
        archive of fake everyday social media posts created using AI tools. The project questions the ever-more
        commodified digital space and how commodification in the attention economy changes how we engage with social
        media.
        <br><br>
        The project's title plays the term "UGC" which stands for "User-generated content," and has become popular
        lately as a way for passive income through affiliated marketing. This trend spurs the production of soulless
        content, which is often mass-produced with AI tools such as ChatGPT and so on—populating social media with
        visual content that is disingenuine to the actual life but truthful to its capitalistic desire. Hence, Wu
        changes the term "UGC" into "UUGH," resembling the sound of "uh" (呃 in Chinese) to express the constant
        frustration and unpleasantness of being fed such content.
        <br><br>
        The project documents the transcript of conversations between Wu and ChatGPT as a record of his daily experience
        for a month, Instagram captions generated by ChatGPT, and images/videos generated through those captions in
        Dall.e, Midjourney, or D-ID. Everything is compiled and displayed on a website resembling a typical social media
        platform. The project explores the meaning of posting as a daily practice of reflection instead of laborious
        production. At the same time, Wu hopes to examine and experiment with alternative ways of using or collaborating
        with AI tools besides mass production. Teasing the cold language AI model creates moments of breakage where the
        conversation feels slightly absurd but familiar.
        <br><br>
        Many thanks to Nashwa Lina Khan at Whippersnapper Gallery for managing the OD/FR residency that supports this
        project's creation and to Kianna Nomsa Mkhonza, Omar Musleh, and Nael Abu-Jazar for building this website.
