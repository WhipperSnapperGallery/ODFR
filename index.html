                    <p><b>FAN WU:</b></p><br />
		<p>I can’t stop thinking about this line from American writer Dennis Cooper’s poem “Being Aware”:</p>
		<p>He took a deep breath, stripped, and they never forgot how he trembled.</p>
		<p>Nothing is quite as mundane, quite as spectacular as recognition. Before the contours of being on display and for review show up in a social media context, there’s the fundamental condition of the act of recognition. Nothing is quite as horrifying, quite as ecstatic as this act in live time. A stranger’s projections latch onto you in a crowded room. Your lover’s affinity for you intensifies and withdraws in a cycle whose rhythm is too receded for you to follow. Late in the night, a fox stops and stares at you for the duration of a single breath at Trinity Bellwoods Park. To be in the world is to be subject to recognition’s complex matrices as they criss-cross into us, drawing a line from first caregiver to final friend, hands held in crib or on deathbed.</p>
<p>Cooper’s line expresses the fantasy of stripping yourself bare when facing the recognition of others. The boy’s shiver of vulnerability makes a counter-impression on the powerful men who surround him; the abandonment of all his defenses generates a strange force that lays normative power bare. Let myself be shown in the full transparency of flesh, in the fullness of my fear, the boy seems to say. So much of anxiety is about recognition (How will I be seen? What will they think of me?). The thrill of Cooper’s fantas
y is that it says bring on all the modes of recognition beyond my control; I can bear it, and my bearing it will make a scar upon your memory.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I can’t stop thinking about this passage from Kurt Cobain’s suicide note:</p>
<p>“For example, when we’re back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins, it doesn’t affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can’t fool you, any one of you.”</p>
<p>What Cobain felt he lacked was Mercury’s total embrace of being seen, at least when he was on stage. Witness Freddie’s energy during “Radio Gaga” at Live Aid. Cobain, au contraire, was tormented by the adoring, ravenous gaze of his audience. It didn’t help that he hated a large portion of his fanbase; he famously wrote in the liner notes of In Utero: “If you’re a sexist, racist, homophobe or basically an a--hole, don’t buy this CD. I don’t care if you like me, I hate you.”</p>
<p>Today, we negotiate a world in which we give ourselves over to exposure – and offer ourselves to our own inner circles of paparazzi. Many of us handle this with an oscillatory ambivalence: don’t look at me and I need to be seen. In a paradoxical motion, we withdraw at the same time as we’re drawn forth by internet personae and their infinite appetites.</p>
<p>The artists in our Whippersnapper residency bring out that ambivalence in specific technological instantiations: digital blackface, racializing algorithms, online love, and the surveillance of sponsorship. They recreate the artifices of Instagram, chatrooms, and other social media platforms to subvert the dominant and prescriptive structures that confine and delimit dominant forms of recognition. Over the next few months, we will explore constellations of power, anxiety, and intersubjectivity in these modern games of recognition.</p>

	<p><b>SARAH:</b></p>
<p>there was no sign of a door, or a handle<br />
the space revealed itself to me so I stepped in</p>
<p>people walked in different directions<br />
and never towards one another</p>
<p>I stood back, silent and observant, trying to make sense of what was around me</p>
<p>there was a noise in the back that I couldn’t pinpoint,<br />
sporadic and rapid, various clicks followed by pauses</p>
<p>I stood back, silent and observant, unsure of what to do</p>
<p>I realized shortly after that people’s movement had a rhythm<br />
most individuals waited on someone to take a step forward, to then move<br />
as if a step forward was only viable if another had already moved<br />
at times much bigger than the first step taken, at times a tiny hesitant one, a step was a reaction to another</p>
<p>I stood back, (again as though things did not always exist in repetition around here) trying to make sense of the space I was<br /> 
shortsighted, white noise,, dark, sweaty, dull, no order in sight<br />
I thought of how Louise Bourgeois said that “you pile up associations the way you pile up brick”<br />
that “memory itself is a form of architecture”<br />
And it dawned on me that remembrance is navigating a space that was built for you<br />
an attempt at understanding where I was wasn’t worth a shot<br />
nothing resonated, nothing fit in old patterns</p>

<p>several people joined the first two that moved, still, as reactions to each other<br />
they formed a single line behind the one responsible for the first step</p>
<p>If the first wanted to meet the fifth, they would have to move all the way back <br />
and the imprint of their initial step forward would linger </p>
<p>I stood back, confused at the choice of a line <br />
nothing about the space looked like a corridor but for some reason their bodies obeyed its shape <br />
I thought of Waguih Ghali<br />
“You’re like a man who buys a valveless radio because he likes silence”</p>
<p>Two people tried moving at the same time<br />
I saw the hesitation, two shadows swaying <br />
the result was still the same <br />
one moved ahead and the other right behind <br />
all of it seemed absurd </p>
<p>I wanted to scream and assumed my scream would also end up in that corridor <br />
as a unit, waiting for its successor</p>
<p>Whoever took a step and no one followed<br />
remained somewhat peripheral <br />
Out of this orderly swarm </p>
<p>I stood back<br />
one could only move after another <br />
nowhere to meet halfway, on equal grounds </p>
<p>I stood back, with a desire to move with someone <br />
find someone who would want to move with me<br />
towards me <br />
and no one to follow </p>

                    <p>On Lingxiang Wu’s UUGH</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Daoism valorises non-productivity, non-utility, wu wei 無爲, effortless action; so I valorise Daoism and claim its authority for my own stunning refusal of the world of work.</p>
                    <p>“Hell” is but a network of idle hands.</p>
                    <p>Language is provisional, except a computer wants clarity above all, winnowing the sentences down to a nub of comprehension. The trees in Bickford Park come off essentially digital. A light comes on from under the bathroom door.</p>
                    <p>In China, the youths lie down flat to protest the culture of body-destroying work, or hold up blank pieces of paper to protest the government’s tyrannical COVID policies. The government is bereft of proof that these gestures are revolutionary. When content is meticulously censored, the political subject resorts to a kind of defiant self-censorship whose only representation is the void.</p>
                    <p>Void of doing, void of seeking, void of attachment. In Lingxiang’s UUGH (Unproductive User-Generated Hell), the void hides beneath the blanketing positivity of AI programming. So much so that Ling is constantly pleading for his AI companion to neutralize its tone. Even though the AI has nothing to lose for itself, it takes the fewest risks possible.</p>
                    <p>Dumb unmanageable world of anxiety in whose lion’s mouth I rest my head.</p>
                    <p>The image with the caption <i>"Feeling alone and wondering if I'll ever find someone to share my life with. Does anyone else feel this way? #alone #datingstruggles #hopelessromantic #loveless #connection #emotionalrollercoaster”</i> is of a figure in a boat looking upward at the back of someone else’s jacket. The boater sits on top of a cluster of rusted-out flowers. The poet sits alone, drunk, waiting to drown by mistaking the reflection of the moon for the moon itself. The artist waits at home, restless, feeding pieces of himself to the inexact mirror of the program. The loneliness of the romantic is at once reduced and amplified by the tender curtness of our artificially intelligent friend, upon whom we come to rely.</p><br />

                    <p>Our desire to dance left us, and we were left with each other and a sense of curiosity and boredom. We wandered off and accidentally ended up along a hallway with many doors. Each door had a little label, letting us know the name of the room. Compelled by three of them, Shams lead the way</p>
                    <p>Late Nights<span class="tab"> </span>l0ve2watch<span class="tab"> </span>love x x love</p>
<p>The room seeped with youth. The aesthetics seem to be of another time; no millennial pinks or blues, nudes or pastels. The colours were gimmicky and beautiful, with neon yellow and pink, whimsical and silly, in the best way possible. There was paper laying around and we were invited to draw and take the drawings home, as if a colouring menu for kids at a restaurant</p>
<p>We found a publication called ObjEct PErmanancy a ZinE. “Reading words mixed of lowercase and uppercase makes me hear them”, Shams chuckled and said. We flipped through pixelated and distorted pics. They looked like an image that was still downloading, or as if it rained on a phone screen while waiting for a bus. These references feel recent and related to 21st century technology, but the drawings on the images in the zine reminded us of Microsoft Paint and the time we’d spent drawing.</p>
<p>The room was filled with  bookshelves that were void of books. They looked as if they held the weight of site links; late night questions, weather double checks and checking when a food expires. A little game stand was in the corner of the room listing the resources used. The room also had the credits of its designers and supporters! We squiggled again, and walked out the door.</p>
<p>The portal in that room was like a chatbot on a commercial website that asks if they can help you in any way. The chat was friendlier than bots, it asked how we were, what our relationship with the internet was and the usage of punctuation was intuitive. Tee thanked us for hanging out today and used the endearing smiley face with the dash and parentheses.</p>
<p>Late Nights<span ="tab"> </span>l0ve2watch<span ="tab"> </span>love x x love</p>
<p>It [the internet] wasn’t until facebook that it felt ‘cohesive’ and ‘directed’ and all the things that propelled web 3.0 into a snazzy online world wide shopping mall and social media black hole Tee writes</p>
<p>Late Nights<span ="tab"> </span>l0ve2watch<span ="tab"> </span>love x x love</p>
<p>We walked into Tennessee's room with ease. The door was blue and welcoming and had a fun title to it, ‘love to watch’ written with numbers, reminiscent of Shams and I’s ‘ily’ ‘ilysm2’ era. The radio was on and it played an underlying symphony, some sort of classical music, that while pleasant, felt a bit unsettling. Papers, prints, mementos lay around, piled upon each other. Shams said it looked like a room that was home to heartbreak.</p>
<p>Some of the notepads read “to see from below”, “to see from below meaning”, “why am i obsessed with my ex”. I laughed at the sight of a printed meme with text over a bird that read “I DON’T WANT TO BE DESIRED I WANT TO BE GENUINELY CARED FOR”</p>
<p>The space was quite overwhelming. Other than the intense sense of longing, there were a bunch of screens that played live camera shots of weird places; goat and horse stables, barns, a supermarket. Shams wasn’t sure what to make of that, “visibility, perception et al?”</p>
<p>At some point, we came across a screen recording on a phone, of Tennessee and a friend texting</p>
<p>“U would literally freak him out so much” </p>
<p>“AHAHAHA i do have that effect on ppl” </p>
<p>“but u could make it up LOL like for art” </p>
<p>Late Nights<span class="tab"> </span>l0ve2watch<span class="tab"> </span>love x x love</p>
<p>What does art afford us to do? And why is it so wonderful, and silly, to reveal a truth in the name of art? </p>
<p>Late Nights<span class="tab"> </span>l0ve2watch<span class="tab"> </span>love x x love</p>
<p>This room felt quite uncomfortable. We were met with screens playing videos, on mirrors. The mirrors were translucent enough for us to see ourselves if we wanted, and opaque enough to watch the men on it–very omegle aesthetics. The men, concealing their faces, demanding to be shown something, some thing. The men kept being asked if they were in love and the answers varied from “See you, please”, “Show me” to “Nah”. It was funny seeing the questions being asked by “You” and answered by “Partner”. A man walked into the room when we were in it. I observed the way he started at the screens and wondered whether it was as appalling for him as it was for us. We clicked on a button that said “Accept Connection” and the screen also asked us, the people standing, “Are you in love?”. Was he? Did it cross his mind that this is his gender’s introduction to attraction and desire, and their conflation with love, the responsibility that comes with it?</p>
<p>I thought of the first room before, the bright pinks and yellow, and how much I loved that version of space more. Shams reminded me of something Tee had written. We took a photo of it: </p>
<p>I want us to be in love ok? Like that kind of love where we care for each other. The kind of love that, yes, gets each other iced vanilla lattes* when we can, but also, like. Checks in with each other and feels safe with each other and is in staunch solidarity with each other: your hurt is my hurt, what happens to you happens to me. Babe, the world’s fucked uppp. But I still want to get to know you and love you. That's the vibe, ok?</p>
<p>Late Nights<span class="tab"> </span>l0ve2watch<span class="tab"> </span>love x x love</p>
<p>“What was it like?” </p>
<p>“Why did the love become hell?” </p>
<p>“Idk” </p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>I want us to love again. Like, love being online, love ourselves, love connection (that does not feel like exploitation), and like, lowkey, think critically about the infrastructures that allow us to be online</p>
<p>There were instances where we would feel like we left the room and went somewhere. We weren’t looking at a cupboard anymore but standing in a space with a force, as if we were a dot on a continuum, or a wagon lost on train tracks. Shams said it’s weird that even though we were at a party, originally, all these rooms, one way or another, spoke of desire and longing. Shams and I thought of tumblr and I went back to see what my first reblogs were.</p>
<p>When I recount that night, I find myself leaning towards analogies. Usually, I find them fun and soothing; equating the feeling of not being awake yet, when I’ve been up for hours, to a cartoon character that’s been flattened by an object that fell on top of it ‘my body just needs some time to adjust’, or when i tell a friend that she feels like the letter ‘l’ in the alphabet, versatile, strong and elegant. </p>
<p>These spaces, which echo digital spheres, were hard to confine to an analogy of a ‘room’, although they did feel like rooms. The messy cupboards, the mirror, the feeling of wandering off and ending up in that space for a while, the music a little muffled, old feelings resurfacing. The internet itself–whatever that is–, is not as kind anymore. Its innocence vanished with a renovation, a repainting of the walls, and its commitment to write only using letters, not numbers.</p>
