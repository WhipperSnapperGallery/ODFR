                <p>I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about this line from American writer Dennis Cooper&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Being Aware&rdquo;:</p>

<p>He took a deep breath, stripped, and they never forgot how he trembled.</p>

<p>Nothing is quite as mundane, quite as spectacular as recognition. Before the contours of being on display and for review show up in a social media context, there&rsquo;s the fundamental condition of the act of recognition. Nothing is quite as horrifying, quite as ecstatic as this act in live time. A stranger&rsquo;s projections latch onto you in a crowded room. Your lover&rsquo;s affinity for you intensifies and withdraws in a cycle whose rhythm is too receded for you to follow. Late in the night, a fox stops and stares at you for the duration of a single breath at Trinity Bellwoods Park. To be in the world is to be subject to recognition&rsquo;s complex matrices as they criss-cross into us, drawing a line from first caregiver to final friend, hands held in crib or on deathbed.</p>

<p>Cooper&rsquo;s line expresses the fantasy of stripping yourself bare when facing the recognition of others. The boy&rsquo;s shiver of vulnerability makes a counter-impression on the powerful men who surround him; the abandonment of all his defenses generates a strange force that lays normative power bare. Let myself be shown in the full transparency of flesh, in the fullness of my fear, the boy seems to say. So much of anxiety is about recognition (How will I be seen? What will they think of me?). The thrill of Cooper&rsquo;s fantas y is that it says bring on all the modes of recognition beyond my control; I can bear it, and my bearing it will make a scar upon your memory.</p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about this passage from Kurt Cobain&rsquo;s suicide note:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, when we&rsquo;re back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins, it doesn&rsquo;t affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can&rsquo;t fool you, any one of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Cobain felt he lacked was Mercury&rsquo;s total embrace of being seen, at least when he was on stage. Witness Freddie&rsquo;s energy during &ldquo;Radio Gaga&rdquo; at Live Aid. Cobain, au contraire, was tormented by the adoring, ravenous gaze of his audience. It didn&rsquo;t help that he hated a large portion of his fanbase; he famously wrote in the liner notes of In Utero: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a sexist, racist, homophobe or basically an a--hole, don&rsquo;t buy this CD. I don&rsquo;t care if you like me, I hate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, we negotiate a world in which we give ourselves over to exposure &ndash; and offer ourselves to our own inner circles of paparazzi. Many of us handle this with an oscillatory ambivalence: don&rsquo;t look at me and I need to be seen. In a paradoxical motion, we withdraw at the same time as we&rsquo;re drawn forth by internet personae and their infinite appetites.</p>

<p>The artists in our Whippersnapper residency bring out that ambivalence in specific technological instantiations: digital blackface, racializing algorithms, online love, and the surveillance of sponsorship. They recreate the artifices of Instagram, chatrooms, and other social media platforms to subvert the dominant and prescriptive structures that confine and delimit dominant forms of recognition. Over the next few months, we will explore constellations of power, anxiety, and intersubjectivity in these modern games of recognition.</p>

                <p>there was no sign of a door, or a handle  the space revealed itself to me so I stepped in</p>

                <p>people walked in different directions and never towards one another</p>
                
                <p>I stood back, silent and observant, trying to make sense of what was around me</p>
                
                <p>there was a noise in the back that I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint, sporadic and rapid, various clicks followed by pauses</p>
                
                <p>I stood back, silent and observant, unsure of what to do</p>
                
                <p>I realized shortly after that people&rsquo;s movement had a rhythm  most individuals waited on someone to take a step forward, to then move  as if a step forward was only viable if another had already moved  at times much bigger than the first step taken, at times a tiny hesitant one, a step was a reaction to another</p>
                
                <p>I stood back, (again as though things did not always exist in repetition around here) trying to make sense of the space I was  shortsighted, white noise,, dark, sweaty, dull, no order in sight  I thought of how Louise Bourgeois said that &ldquo;you pile up associations the way you pile up brick&rdquo;  that &ldquo;memory itself is a form of architecture&rdquo; And it dawned on me that remembrance is navigating a space that was built for you  an attempt at understanding where I was wasn&rsquo;t worth a shot nothing resonated, nothing fit in old patterns</p>
                
                <p>several people joined the first two that moved, still, as reactions to each other  they formed a single line behind the one responsible for the first step</p>
                
                <p>If the first wanted to meet the fifth, they would have to move all the way back  and the imprint of their initial step forward would linger</p>
                
                <p>I stood back, confused at the choice of a line  nothing about the space looked like a corridor but for some reason their bodies obeyed its shape  I thought of Waguih Ghali &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a man who buys a valveless radio because he likes silence&rdquo;</p>
                
                <p>Two people tried moving at the same time I saw the hesitation, two shadows swaying  the result was still the same  one moved ahead and the other right behind  all of it seemed absurd</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to scream and assumed my scream would also end up in that corridor  as a unit, waiting for its successor</p>
                
                <p>Whoever took a step and no one followed remained somewhat peripheral  Out of this orderly swarm</p>
                
                <p>I stood back one could only move after another  nowhere to meet halfway, on equal grounds</p>
                
                <p>I stood back, with a desire to move with someone  find someone who would want to move with me towards me  and no one to follow</p>
