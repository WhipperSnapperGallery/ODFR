Running this project requires NodeJS and Visual Studio Code. Refer to the official websites for download and install instructions prior to running this project.

To run locally, ensure you have NodeJS and Visual Studio Code installed. Then download the source code or clone the repository to your desktop folder, and do the following:
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Create a new terminal by hitting Ctrl+Shift+\` (Windows) or ^+Shift+\` (Mac).
3. In the small window that pops up, type 'npm run make' and press enter. Wait for this script to finish.
4. You will need to install Live Server if you want to run the project in real time on your computer. To do this, first navigate to the extensions tab in VS Code (in the sidebar, this looks like four squares with the top right one disconnected from the others)
5. In the search bar at the top (where it says 'Search Extensions in Marketplace'), type "Live Server" and install the first result.
6. Go to the files tab (two pieces of paper on the sidebar, usually at the top) and open index.html
7. After installing live server, there should be a small "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VS Code window. Click this button and the webpage should open automatically in your browser.
